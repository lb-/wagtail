## What's new

### Page editor redesign

Here are other changes related to the redesign:

 * Switch the Wagtail branding font to a system font stack (Steven Steinwand)

### Other features

 * Upgrade ESLint and Stylelint configurations to latest shared Wagtail configs (Thibaud Colas)
 * Major updates to frontend tooling; move Node tooling from Gulp to Webpack, upgrade to Node v16 and npm v8, eslint v8, stylelint v14 and others (Thibaud Colas)
 * Change comment headersâ€™ date formatting to use browser APIs instead of requiring a library (LB (Ben Johnston))
 * Lint with flake8-comprehensions and flake8-assertive (Mads Jensen)


### Bug fixes


## Upgrade considerations

### Hallo legacy rich text editor has moved to an external package

* Hallo was deprecated in in [Wagtail v2.0 (February 2018)](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/releases/2.0.html#new-rich-text-editor) and has not received any bug fixes with only a minimal level of support since then.
* If you still require Hallo for your Wagtail installation, you will need to install the [Wagtail legacy Hallo editor](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-hallo) package.
* There will be no ongoing support for this package beyond this release.
* `window.registerHallowPlugin` will no longer be created on the page editor load unless the legacy package is installed.
